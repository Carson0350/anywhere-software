## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Story Generation
Generate the remaining 13 story files for Epics 5-7. This will provide complete documentation for all 34 stories.

**Pros:**
- Complete documentation set
- Dev agent has all details upfront
- No need to reference epics.md during development

**Cons:**
- Takes additional time now
- Some stories may need adjustment during development

### Option 2: Start Development with Epics 1-4
Begin development with the 21 completed stories. Generate remaining stories as needed.

**Pros:**
- Start building immediately
- Learn from early implementation
- Adjust remaining stories based on learnings

**Cons:**
- Need to generate stories during development
- Potential context switching

### Option 3: Generate Stories Just-In-Time
Generate Epic 5 stories when Epic 4 is complete, Epic 6 when Epic 5 is complete, etc.

**Pros:**
- Balance between planning and agility
- Incorporate learnings from previous epics
- Maintain momentum

**Cons:**
- Requires coordination between PM and dev
- Potential delays between epics
